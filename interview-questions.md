# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is the repeating of a process until a condition is met. Arrays and strings can be iterated.

  Researched answer: Iteration is when a particular action is performed a certain number of times or until a condition is met. There are certain data types, such as strings and arrays, that are conducive to iterations. These particular data types have length properties. An example of using iterations are for loops. For loops allow the developer to define where the index starts, how many iterations the loop is set to go through, as well as the return after each loop. By using for statements, a loop can be used until the condition evalutates to false.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The predefined parameters for the JavaScript built in method .map() are value, index, and array in that specific order. Only the value parameter is required. The index and array parameters can be used but are not required.

  Researched answer: .map(), .filter(), and .forEach() are all higher-order functions in JavaScript meaning they are all functions that can either take in a function as an argument or they can return another function as an output. These three higher order functions are built in methods in JavaScript that act on arrays. They all have three built in parameters, the value, the index, and the array. The value is the required parameter which represents the current iterations value of the array. Index is an optional parameter that represents the specific index of the array at the current iteration. Lastly, the array parameter is also not required but represents the called on higher-order function. The order will always be the same (value, index, array) but the names can be arbitrary.



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object is a key: value pair. Object destructuring is a way of creating a new pathway to the key.

  Researched answer: Object destructuring allows the developer to unpack values in an array or object into individual variables. This is a way of assigning variable in JavaScript. By breaking the object into individual variables allows these variables to be recallable or reusable. With object destructuring, the developer can extract multiple properties.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: Functions are generic and reusable blocks of code that provide detailed instructions on how do to a task. These instructions are reusable. Methods are a type of function that is stored as an object property.

  Researched answer: Functions are executed when it is called or invoked. Functions are named just like variables using camelCase with a variable declaration. They are then set equal to parameter in parentheses which is followed by the arrow function syntax (=>). After the arrow are {} curly braces that encapsulates the code block. The return of the function describes the output; every function must have a return. Methods operate the data contained in a class. The code of a method can be called by its method name or by the name of its object. Methods are a way for objects to be implicitly passed when it is called on.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: An object is a key: value pair. Classes are the blueprints for objects that are reusable. Objects are instances of the class. Each object in the class are independent from each other. An example of an object are arrays. 

  Researched answer: Classes are templates or blueprints for objects. They define the properties for the objects. Class names use Pascalcase naming convention. Classes use a constructor to create and initialize objects. The JavaScript keyword 'this.' is a way to refer to the object and 'new' is used when a new instance of a class is created. The properties of an object all have values that are explicitly defined but object values must be a JavaScript data type. Objets hold collections such as arrays.
